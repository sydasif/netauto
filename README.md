NetAuto is a web-based platform designed to centralize the management and automation of network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. It provides a simple, clean interface for maintaining a device inventory and executing commands, with a modular architecture for future expansion.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Centralized Device Inventory**: A single source of truth for all your network devices.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete devices through a web UI and the Django admin panel.
-   **SSH-Based Automation**: (Planned) Leverage Nornir and Netmiko/Napalm to run commands and push configurations to multiple devices simultaneously.
-   **Modular & Extensible**: Designed with Django apps to easily add new functionality like user roles, job scheduling, monitoring, and a REST API.
-   **Minimalist UI**: Simple and effective frontend using Django Templates, focusing on functionality over complexity.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local development environment running.

### Prerequisites

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9 or higher)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/netauto.git
    cd netauto
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `Django`, `nornir`, etc.)*

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and set a `SECRET_KEY`. You can generate one easily.
    ```ini
    # .env
    SECRET_KEY='your-super-secret-key-here'
    DEBUG=True
    ```

5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    This will create the database schema, including the `NetworkDevice` table.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser:**
    This account will be used to access the Django admin interface.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

8.  **Access the application:**
    -   **Web App**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
    -   **Admin Panel**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)

## üîê Security Considerations

-   **Secrets Management**: Never commit your `.env` file or any other files containing sensitive credentials to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets management tool in production.
-   **Password Storage**: The `NetworkDevice` model stores passwords in plaintext for automation. In a production environment, this is highly discouraged. Use a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Ansible Vault) and integrate it with the application.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The `users` app is planned to implement RBAC, restricting device access and job execution capabilities based on user roles (e.g., Admin vs. Operator).
-   **Debug Mode**: Ensure `DEBUG` is set to `False` in production environments.
